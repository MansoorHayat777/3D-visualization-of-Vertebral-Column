Project Overview: 3D Visualization of Vertebral Column from CT Scan

Objective:
Develop an in-depth 3D visualization of a patient's vertebral column using CT scan data.

Methodology:

Data Analysis: Utilizing Python, I meticulously analyzed .dcm files, with a keen focus on three crucial dimensions: axial, sagittal, and coronal.
Segmentation and 3D Modeling: Employing the advanced capabilities of 3D Slicer software, I segmented the Dicom files, which was instrumental in constructing a detailed and precise three-dimensional model of the vertebral column.
Outcome:
This project successfully culminates in a comprehensive three-dimensional representation of the vertebral column, providing significant insights and visualizations derived from the patient's CT scan data.
